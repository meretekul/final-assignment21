                    Our travel could have almost started and stopped in <span>Havana</span>, as the town is like an old history book in itself. 
                    From old soviet buildings to art deco theatres. And keep in mind that the past and the present is interwoven like a Persian carpet. <br>
                    For eating in style go to Centro Habana or Habana Vieja and try out a dish called Ropa Vieja. 
                    This is one of the national dishes of Cuba, its served with rice, black beans and fried plantains.

                    she would merengue and do the cha-cha" and where she Cha-Chad we are heading next.  
                </p> 
                <p>
                    When I think of <span>Rio de Janeiro</span>  one song comes to mind: Copacabana song by Barry Manilow. 
                    So why don't try to visit the Copacabana beach, not only for the sun and sea but also due to the lively Neiborhood and for a look at the hotel that Barry Manilow frequented. 
                    And there is no visit to Rio if you do not go and check out Christ the Redeemer statue. <br>
                    For food try out some of the local flavour in the mobile stalls or snack bars and try out the traditional Brazilian stew called Feijoada.

                    Who in Norway do not know the name: Thorbjørn Egner, and most Norwegians have childhood memories of the book: “Folk og Røvere i Kardemommeby”.  
                    What most are unaware of is that the book is inspired by a cultural trip Egner took to Essaouira, so when continuing our journey that is where we are heading.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    When in <span>Essaouira</span> drink a coffee with cardamon and relax as the main focal point of this coastal town is its relaxing atmosphere. 
                    If you like us do not like the hassle of Marrakech, try then the Souq's and see if you can get a steal. If you want to do something more active the beaches here is a great spot for surfing. 
                    Or maybe try a traditional hammam. After all of the sighting try out a nice traditional soup called Harira. An old Berber soup and it's a great comfort after the cold waves of surfing.

                    If it is galleries, Piazza, churches, museums or libraries you are after then <span>Florence</span> have it all and this is also the next stop. 
                    We would recommend when visiting to also go to the Oltrarno Area to walk among history, but also to get some food. <br>
                    When thinking about Italy and food, the first thing that will come to mind are Pizza, Pasta or maybe even wine. 
                    But we would recommend adding Ribollita to that list. Ribolitta is comfort food in Florence. It's a small taste of Nonna's cooking in Italy.

                    In this next destination we will introduce you to a way of life and a place that you will either love or hate: <span>Kolkata</span> or Calcutta.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will experience the Bengali people and their way of life, their culture and their food, and also a city that lives after its heart and where old and new melds. 
                    Go to Kumortuli and get a clay figure of your favourite Hindi god. Or go to a temple to get your blessings or maybe visit the Vicotria Palace for some architecture. <br>
                    For food we recommend street vendors, to get the real flavours of Kolkata and specially to try out Keemar Doi Bora.

                    What better place to stop this food journey then in <span>Tokyo</span> , known for its hustle and bustle and its modern city centre. <br>
                    If you are a Pokémon fan, the best place to go would be the Pokémon mega centre. If you want something more cultural you should go to Meiji Jingu Shrine or the Senso-ji I Temple. 
                    If you are not afraid of hights then a visit to Tokiyo Skytree is a must. <br>
                    When it comes to food, the options are plenty, all from shushi to wagashi, but we would also recommend to try out a dish with Tofu. 
                    As this is one of the main ingredients in Japanese cooking and it has been for over 2000 years.
