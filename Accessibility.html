            <h2>Testing the accessibility</h2>
            <p>
                According to <span>Achecker</span> we got a contrast error on our <span>Technology and society</span> page, 
                however we have used the same CSS on every page and the error didn’t come up anywhere else. We didn’t get any errors on Wave. <br>
                However, just to be on the safe side, we did darken the opacity of our semi-transparent box, just to make it easier to read. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We also got an error suggesting that we should specify the language used on the page. This is again strange, as we used the HTML 5 that specifies the language used as a default. 
                We, again, only got the error on one of our pages, and we’ve used the same on all pages. On Wave we didn’t get any errors. <br>
                One thing that we couldn’t do anything about, is that the <span>Achecker</span> said that there was a problem with one of our images. 
                Our biggest problem is that we don’t have any images and therefore, we found it difficult to correct this issue. <br>
                Some errors however, we could do something about. We added alternative texts to where it was appropriate, to make sure that hard-of-seeing people also could enjoy our webpage. 
                We also changed out some of our IDs with classes.  
            </p>
            <p>
                To make sure that our page functions satisfactorily, we have checked our page on different sized screens, in this case; iPad Pro 11”, iPhone Xr, Samsung S21. As well as the normal laptop screen and desktop. <br>
                Our pages functions very well on all screen sizes, including the so-called hamburger menu, which we have never used before. Our reasoning for this is that the hamburger menu is well-known as the most responsive type of menu. 
                It is also one of the most classic menus. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We have made sure to mark the visited links with underscores as well color, so that people with color-blindness also will be able to differentiate which links have been visited. <br>
                We also thought about typography and have only used two different fonts across all our pages. The headers are in "Cinzel", a serif-type font with only capital letters that works very well on headings, and to differentiate we used "Sawarabi Mincho" on the rest of the text. <br>
                This is also to make sure that there is enough of a difference between the headers and the rest of the text <a class="title" target="_blank" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-typography-determines-readability-serif-vs-sans-serif-and-how-to-combine-fonts-629a51ad8cce/">(www.freecodecamp.org)</a>.
                We have also made sure that both our home button and our hamburger reacts when your pointer comes near, so that our users know that they are clickable and reactive.
            </p>

            <p>
                On the lines in question, we don’t have images, so we don’t know how to fix the problem that we’re talking about.
            </p>
            <p>
                According to the web.dev page <a class="title" target="_blank" href="https://web.dev/measure/?gclid=CjwKCAiA4veMBhAMEiwAU4XRrw9SrgOawsCzaz_K-hpxLk8grt1UULZ-4vOkB0iHZOvMuTYlqD1iHxoCRe8QAvD_BwE">(web.dev/measure)</a>
                our page is on 95 on performance and a 100 in accessibility.
