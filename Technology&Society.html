            <p><span>
                The Internet has grown into a ubiquitous infrastructure that societies all over the world are increasingly reliant on. 
                To which extent and how does the internet have political consequences? Note down some examples and discuss with your colleagues.
            </span></p>
            <p>
                The internet is everywhere. <br>
                It has become a ubiquitous force and has made itself unavoidable to most people in their everyday lives. 
                But as so often happens, when something has power and the ability to influence, it has become a political tool.
                While it on one hand makes life easier and more accessible, it can also influence the way people think about important issues. It can, if used correctly, elevate a political candidate above all others. 
                Think about how, under the election process and period, the social media platforms are stocked to the brim with political ads. 
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the newer problems, and one with the furthest reaching consequences is the challenge of the echo chamber. 
                If you, on social media platforms, only follow people that have the same opinions as you, you’ll end up in a circle of the same things uttered again and again. 
                Sounds reaffirming and safe, however when the opinion is something harmful; think antivaccination, flat-earth and so on, an echo chamber is something that’s extremely difficult to break into and change the minds of those in it.
                The truly dangerous and effective way echo chambers are actively used, is when a government shuts down parts of the internet to block unfriendly or unpatriotic views. <br>
                There are several examples of this happening:
            </p>
            <p>
                - Turkey shutting down YouTube: <a class="title" target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/07/world/europe/turkey-blocks-twitter-youtube-and-sites-that-published-hostage-photo.html">(www.nytimes.com)</a> <br>
                - WhatsApp calls not working in the Emirates: <a class="title" target="_blank" href="https://www.khaleejtimes.com/technology/no-whatsapp-calls-in-the-uae-authority-clarifies">(www.khaleejtimes.com)</a> <br>
                - Cambodia controlling what people can see (and not see) during an election: <a class="title" target="_blank" href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/02/18/cambodia-internet-censorship-control-expanded">(www.hrw.org)</a> <br>
                - And the list goes on … <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                As James Andrew Lewis puts it: “This first “knowledge revolution” contributed to centuries of political turmoil. 
                Internet technologies are producing a similar result, but at a faster pace and with broader effect.” <a class="title" target="_blank" href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/short-discussion-internets-effect-politics">(www.csis.org)</a>

            <h3>Reflection task 4:</h3>
            <p><span>
                Consider the statement "The person who invented the train invented the train crash." What are your thoughts about the societal responsibility of innovators? 
            </span></p>
            <p>
                Robert Oppenheimer's famous line: <a class="title" target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-981-13-7276-6_7">“Now I am become Death, destroyer of worlds”</a> (originally from an old Hindu text) after seeing the devastation his invention could cause, 
                is a fitting reminder that an inventor needs to be able to foresee consequences possible with their inventions.
                The nuclear bomb is perhaps an extreme example, but it shows the truly horrific possibilities that human beings are capable of if they push the limits.  
                It's difficult not to agree 100% with Heather E. Douglas who said: “To not think about plausible unintended effects is to be negligent -- and to recognize, but do nothing about, such effects is to be reckless” 
                <a class="title" target="_blank" href="https://leaps.org/whos-responsible-if-a-scientists-work-is-used-for-harm/">(www.leaps.org)</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inventors have the responsibility to ask themselves the question; can this thing I’ve just invented be used with nefarious purposes as well?  
                A look back at human history and you’ll discover the extraordinary ability humanity has to make even the most innocent and innocuous objects into weapons. Just imagine the possibilities the technological age has to offer.  
                The “game” of invention is truly a balancing act. To discover something and have the upsides and downsides at the very least cancel each other out.  
                A modern example of this: the electric car. Is it, as we first thought, the savior of the motor industry, or as more research has found out, just another pollution criminal?  
                Turns out to be a bit of both. The batteries that drive these technological miracles are (environmentally) expensive to make, to use and to get rid of.
