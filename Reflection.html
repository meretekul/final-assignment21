            <h2>The difference between being a worker and a student</h2>
            <p>
                All the people in our group are over a certain age. 
                By that, we mean that we graduated from high school several years ago, and have been a part of the work force ever since.
                It turns out that there are skills you forget you need when studying, and others that you use in different ways when in an education situation.
                Primary among them is the skill of organizing the workload. 
                One advantage of being at work, especially in a position that you are familiar with, is that you know, more or less, how much time certain tasks will take.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is not the case when it comes to the big obligatory assignments you have to do during the course of higher education. 
                They are unknowns; both in content and in workload. How to parse out the assignments? Who should do what? 
                Should you do the (in this case) coding on one screen, or should every group member do parts of the code and then as a group combine it before handing it in?
                If you get lucky with your group, as we have been, you learn who is good at what, and distribute the assignments accordingly. 
                It is also surprisingly easy to try too hard and to bite off almost more than you can chew.  
            </p>
            <p>
                We started most of our work in a program called Figma. It’s basically an online whiteboard where you can set up the look of the website you want. 
                Depending on your level of skill and the complication level of the website, you can make a highly functional prototype in this program.
                The challenge occurs when the time comes to write up the code that make the website work when it goes live. 
                The little icon or button that looks really good in Figma, becomes a big challenge to actually make work.
                There have been several evenings where we have tried to figure out challenges before the deadline. <br> However, you learn things from being under pressure as well. 
                How long it takes before you get sick of the assignment, the program and each other. How much of that is actually the fact that it is late at night.
                There are challenges, but there are also victories and satisfactions. It is a very good feeling when your pages behave as you wanted them to and everything is happening just by clicking on it. 
                To see the design, you’ve been so pleased with, come to life as a close to fully functional webpage.
                The managing of workloads, the designating of assignments complementing the skills of the people you are working with, knowing how much pressure you can actually withstand, 
                and knowing that you’ll get there in the end, are all skills that will serve us well when we enter back into the workforce after our education is finished.   
            </p>
            <p>
                It turns out that the difference between being a student and a worker / an employee is not as big as you might think, however there are skills that needs to be used differently.
                The workload is immense for both; however, the managing can get complicated as a student unless you learn and utilize some planning skills.
                In conclusion, and to no-one’s real surprise, there are a lot of skills, also outside what we learn in our subjects, that will serve us very well, when we once again head out to once again be a part of the workforce.
